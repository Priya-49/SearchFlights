## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup & Execution  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Creating the Project  
I created the project using **Next.js** with the following command:  
```sh
npx create-next-app@latest searchflights
cd searchflights
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Installing Dependencies  
I installed the required dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up MongoDB Atlas  
I created a MongoDB Atlas cluster and obtained the connection string.  
Then, I whitelisted my IP (`0.0.0.0/0` for open access).

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Configuring Environment Variables  
I created a `.env.local` file in the root directory and added the following:
```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://your-deployment-url/api
```
- Replaced `your_mongodb_connection_string` with my MongoDB Atlas connection string.
- Replaced `your-deployment-url` with my Railway deployment URL.
- I also set these variables in Railway ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Variables.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Implementing Flight Search & Save Features  
- I set up API routes in the `/pages/api/` directory.
- I integrated MongoDB to store and retrieve flight data.
- I used the fetch API to communicate with the backend.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Application Locally  
To test the application on my local machine, I ran:
```sh
npm run dev
```
üîó App was available at `http://localhost:3000`

## üîó API Integration  
| Method | Endpoint            | Description                        |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/flights`      | Fetch available flights           |
| POST   | `/api/save-flight`  | Save a flight to favorites        |
| GET    | `/api/saved-flights` | Retrieve saved flights            |

Ensure that API calls correctly reference the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`.

## üöÄ Deployment on Railway  
1Ô∏è‚É£ I pushed my code to GitHub.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Connected the repository to Railway for deployment.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Set up environment variables (`MONGODB_URI`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`).  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Railway automatically built and deployed the application.
